# Near-real-time updates in JSON format via the retail.red API

The Catalog API can be called directly to perform updates in near real time. There are routes to create/update/delete records for all the different entities. Please check the [retail.red Catalog API](/api-reference/catalog-api) for detailed specifications.

Be sure to also read the [concepts and entity page](concepts-and-entities.md) of the Catalog API.
